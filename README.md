This software is a fork of Armel F4HWN firmware with code from NTOIVOLA, EGZUMER and DUAL TACHYON.

The Sonic Firmware Documentation is in the DOWNLOAD section

## Multiboot and dynamic profiles

Sonic supports the same five-slot multiboot layout and host protocol as F4HWN
Fusion. On the first boot after a normal firmware flash, Sonic saves the running
image as the protected **Main** backup (slot 0). Hold **MENU** while powering on
to open the selector; slots 1 through 4 can be managed by a compatible host tool.

Each slot owns a separate 64 KiB settings profile. Channels, names, VFO state,
Spectrum history and Sonic settings therefore follow the selected firmware,
while calibration and the boot logo remain shared. The active-profile state is
stored redundantly and tied to the expected firmware CRC so a normal firmware
flash is detected and adopted safely.

The USB and RS232 builds expose the Fusion-compatible commands `0x0720` through
`0x0729` for slot info/erase/write/validation and profile reset. Slot 0 cannot be
overwritten or erased by these host commands.

Build artifacts follow the shared metadata convention
`f4hwn.<name>.<variant>.v<version>.bin`: Sonic V52b is emitted as
`f4hwn.sonic.usb.V52b.bin` or `f4hwn.sonic.rs232.V52b.bin`. UVStudio derives the
slot name from `<name>` and stores `v<version>` in the slot header.
